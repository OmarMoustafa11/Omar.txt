LS(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    LS(1)

NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1%] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, asso-
     ciated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted sepa-
     rately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available: 
Whatis - provides a brief description of command line programs.
khaledmoustafa@Khaleds-Air homework % whatis
usage: whatis keyword ...
khaledmoustafa@Khaleds-Air homework % 

Alias - simply specify an alias name and set it to the command.

khaledmoustafa@Khaleds-Air homework % alias
run-help=man
which-command=whence
